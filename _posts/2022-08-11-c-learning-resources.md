TL;DR: C Resources:

- [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
- [Diving into Systems](https://diveintosystems.org/)
- [C Bible](http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf)

# C learning resources

![cover image](/assets/images/c-learning-resources/Cover_image.png)

Blender is mostly written in C:

(Source: Blender github mirror: https://github.com/blender/blender)

The reason fot this is two fold:

1. [Blender is old](https://www.blender.org/about/history/)
2. C is _really_ fast

We're seeing more and more areas of Blender migrate to C++ (I.e, Cycles, etc) but still almost 70% is written in C. Thus, it's still very much worth learning.

Below are a few resources I've found useful:

1. https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

This lecture series does a wonderful job of introducing Computer Science using C. It's not _really_ a C course, rather it explains fundamental CS concepts using C.

2. https://diveintosystems.org/

This is more of a low level system overview explained using C, written for people who know python. It's more than just a C course, but I think it's incredibly valuable to understand why C is written the way it is.

3. [The C Programing Language](http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf)

Considered "The C Bible" this book was written by the language creator, Brian Kenighan and Dennis Ritchie. Not going to lie, it's dense, and _slightly_ outdated. But if you really want to learn C. This book is a must

4. [Reddit C resource compilation ](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/872rlt/c_project_based_tutorials/)

From Books to Video series, this is a list of some of the most useful C resources.

I'm still working through all of these myself, but they have already been a huge help to me. Hopefully they will help you to.

Happy Blendveloping.
